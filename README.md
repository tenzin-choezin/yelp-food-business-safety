# Restaurant Food Safety Reviews 

This project was created as a part of Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science using Python's Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. I investigated restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment was to walk through the process of Data Cleaning and EDA, more specifically:
  - Reading simple csv files and using Pandas
  - Working with data at different levels of granularity
  - Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
  - Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables
